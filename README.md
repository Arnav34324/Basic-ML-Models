# Hybrid Financial Stability Modeling: Integrating Batch and Online Learning Approaches

This repository contains a machine learning project that combines both batch learning and online learning techniques to predict financial stability. The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods to provide a robust, adaptable, and accurate model for classifying financial stability into three classes:
1. Financially Stable
2. Moderately Stable
3. Financially Unstable

## Overview

In this project, we use:
- **Batch Learning:** Using a RandomForestClassifier to train on the entire dataset (offline learning) to establish a robust baseline.
- **Online Learning:** Using an SGDClassifier with the `partial_fit` method to update the model incrementally as new data arrives, simulating real-time learning.

The repository also includes extensive visualizations to compare the performance and feature importance of both models.

## Dataset and Feature Engineering

- **Dataset:** The model uses a financial dataset (e.g., Indian finance data) which is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Feature Engineering:** The project includes:
  - Creation of new financial ratios (e.g., Debt-to-Income Ratio, Savings-to-Income Ratio).
  - Dropping irrelevant columns.
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Occupation, City Tier).
  - Stratified train-test split and standardization using `StandardScaler`.

## Models

### Offline Model: RandomForestClassifier

- **Purpose:** Establishes a baseline by training on the complete dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Feature Importance:** Extracted directly from the model to highlight the most influential features.

### Online Model: SGDClassifier

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates incremental learning using `partial_fit` for real-time model updates.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.
- **Feature Importance:** For the linear SGDClassifier, the average absolute coefficients are used as a proxy for feature importance.

## Visualizations

The repository includes separate sections for offline and online model visualizations:
- **Offline (Batch) Visualizations:**
  - Bar and pie charts showing the distribution of financial stability classes.
  - Feature importance plot from RandomForest.
  - Confusion matrix.
- **Online Visualizations:**
  - Bar and pie charts for model predictions.
  - Confusion matrix.
  - Feature importance plot based on averaged absolute coefficients from SGDClassifier.

Each visualization is generated with clear labels and spacing to ensure clarity.

## Web API Integration

A Flask API is implemented to allow continuous model updates for the online model. The API exposes an endpoint `/update` where new data (in JSON format) can be sent to update the SGDClassifier using `partial_fit`. The API handles data preprocessing (using the pre-fitted scaler) and updates the model incrementally.

Refer to the `api.py` file in the `src/` folder for the full implementation details.

# Hybrid Financial Stability Modeling: Integrating Batch and Online Learning Approaches

This repository contains a machine learning project that combines batch learning and online learning techniques to predict financial stability. By integrating a RandomForestClassifier (offline/batch model) with an SGDClassifier (online model updated incrementally via partial_fit), the project demonstrates a robust and adaptable solution for classifying financial stability into three classes:

1. Financially Stable
2. Moderately Stable
3. Financially Unstable

## Overview

The hybrid approach leverages:
- **Batch Learning:** Trains a RandomForestClassifier on the entire dataset to establish a strong baseline.
- **Online Learning:** Uses an SGDClassifier updated continuously with new data, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- **Visualization:** Comprehensive graphs and metrics (accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots) for both models.

This project is ideal for showcasing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of different learning paradigms—an excellent addition to any ML internship portfolio.

## Dataset and Feature Engineering

- **Dataset:** The model uses a financial dataset (e.g., Indian finance data). Update the CSV path in the code as necessary.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Creation of financial ratios (e.g., Debt-to-Income Ratio, Savings-to-Income Ratio) if the target column is missing.
  - Dropping of irrelevant columns.
  - Encoding of categorical variables.
  - Stratified train-test split and standardization using `StandardScaler`.

## Models

### Offline Model: RandomForestClassifier
- **Purpose:** Establish a baseline by training on the full dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance (from internal model metrics).

### Online Model: SGDClassifier
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates incremental learning by updating the model with new data batches using `partial_fit`.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance (based on averaged absolute coefficients as a proxy).

## Visualizations

The project generates clear, separated visualizations for both models:

- **Offline (Batch) Visualizations:**
  - Bar and pie charts showing the distribution of financial stability classes (ground truth).
  - Feature importance plot from RandomForest.
  - Confusion matrix.
- **Online (Incremental) Visualizations:**
  - Bar and pie charts for the online model predictions.
  - Confusion matrix.
  - Feature importance plot based on averaged absolute coefficients from SGDClassifier.

Each visualization is generated in its own figure with tight layouts and clear labels.

## Web API Integration

A Flask API is implemented to update the online model continuously. The `/update` endpoint accepts JSON payloads with new data and labels, preprocesses the data using the pre-fitted scaler, and updates the SGDClassifier using `partial_fit`. This simulates a real-time data stream where the model learns continuously.
